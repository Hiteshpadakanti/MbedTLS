This document describes rulers and generates scripts for this folder.

This folder should include files that are used by tests and their input data. All the files listed in the final list CAN be regenerated by `make all_final` or `make all_parse_input`.
Output of the commands can be committed and updated to upstream. That's to guarantee the generating commands are valid.
- `make all_parse_input` will output files used by parsing like tests. That is used only for checking commands. The output might break tests.
    - Parse like tests are parse a file and compare with expected result.
- `make all_final` will output other files.

`make tidy`, `make neat` and `make clean` are for cleaning up different types of files.
- `make clean` will remove all intermediate files that won't be upstreamed.
- `make neat` will remove final files except for parsing input files.
- `make tidy` will remove files not listed in `reserved.lst`

This folder includes some list files to be used for different purposes in tests.
- ignored.lst : files that should not be checked in `new or deleted` check.
- reserved.lst: `make tidy` won't remove these files.
- uncategorized.lst:  Same behaviour as `reserved.lst` with some problems. We will remove it after we indentify all problems.

Tool chain list:
- faketime
- xxd
- hexdump
- OpenSSL 3.0.2 (DO NOT add other versions if not neccessary)
