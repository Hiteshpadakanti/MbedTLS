This document descript rulers and generate script for this folder.

This folder should include files that used by tests and their input data. All files list in final list CAN be regenerated by `make all_final` or `make all_parse_input`.
Output of the commands can be commit and updated to upstream. That's for guarantee the generating commands are valid.

`make all_parse_input` is used only for checking commands. The output might break tests. That is for parse like test( parse a file and compare with expected result). Normally, `make all_final` and commit are enough.
`make tidy`, `make neat` and `make clean` are for cleaning up different type files.
- `make clean` will remove all intermediate files( files that won't be upstreamed)
- `make neat` will remove final files except parse input files
- `make tidy` will remove files not list in `reserved.lst`

This folder includes some list files to used for different purpose in tests.
- ignored.lst : files that should not be checked in `new or deleted` check.
- reserved.lst: `make tidy` won't remove those file
- uncategorized.lst: That is same with `reserved.lst` with some problem. We will remove it after we indentify all problem.

Tool chain  list:
- faketime
- xxd
- hexdump
- OpenSSL 3.0.2(DO NOT add other versions if not neccessary)
