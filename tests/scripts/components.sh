# This file contains the test components that are executed by all.sh

# The functions below are named as follows:
#  * component_XXX: independent components. They can be run in any order.
#      * component_check_XXX: quick tests that aren't worth parallelizing.
#      * component_build_XXX: build things but don't run them.
#      * component_test_XXX: build and test.
#      * component_release_XXX: tests that the CI should skip during PR testing.
#  * support_XXX: if support_XXX exists and returns false then
#    component_XXX is not run by default.

# Each component must start by invoking `msg` with a short informative message.
#
# Warning: due to the way bash detects errors, the failure of a command
# inside 'if' or '!' is not detected. Use the 'not' function instead of '!'.
#
# Each component is executed in a separate shell process. The component
# fails if any command in it returns a non-zero status.
#
# The framework in all.sh performs some cleanup tasks after each component.
# This means that components can assume that the working directory is in a
# cleaned-up state, and don't need to perform the cleanup themselves.
# * Run `make clean`.
# * Restore `include/mbedtls/mbedtls_config.h` from a backup made before running
#   the component.
# * Check out `Makefile`, `library/Makefile`, `programs/Makefile`,
#   `tests/Makefile` and `programs/fuzz/Makefile` from git.
#   This cleans up after an in-tree use of CMake.
#
# The tests are roughly in order from fastest to slowest. This doesn't
# have to be exact, but in general you should add slower tests towards
# the end and fast checks near the beginning.
