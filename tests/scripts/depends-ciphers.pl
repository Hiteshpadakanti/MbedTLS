# Copyright (c) 2018, ARM Limited, All Rights Reserved
#
# Purpose
#
# To test the code dependencies on individual ciphers in each test suite. This
# is a verification step to ensure we don't ship test suites that do not work
# for some build options.
#
# The process is:
#       for each possible cipher
#           build the library and test suites with the hash disabled
#           execute the test suites
#
# And any test suite with the wrong dependencies will fail.
#
# Usage: tests/scripts/depends-ciphers.pl
#
# This script should be executed from the root of the project directory.
#
# For best effect, run either with cmake disabled, or cmake enabled in a mode
# that includes -Werror.
