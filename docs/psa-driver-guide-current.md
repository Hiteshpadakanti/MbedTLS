# PSA Cryptoprocessor driver development and integration guide

This document describes how to write and integrate cryptoprocessor drivers, such as accelerators and secure elements, for the PSA cryptography subsystem of the current version of Mbed TLS.

The `docs/proposed/` directory contains three documents which pertain to the proposed, work-in-progress driver system. The [PSA Driver Interface](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/blob/development/docs/proposed/psa-driver-interface.md) describes how drivers will interface with Mbed TLS in the future, as well as driver types, operation types, and entry points. The PSA Driver [Developer](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/blob/development/docs/proposed/psa-driver-developer-guide.md) Guide describes the deliverables for writing a driver that can be used with Mbed TLS, and the PSA Driver [Integration](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/blob/development/docs/proposed/psa-driver-integration-guide.md) Guide describes how a driver can be built alongside Mbed TLS.
