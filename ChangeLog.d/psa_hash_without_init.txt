Features
   * Document that PSA hash operations don't require psa_crypto_init(). This
     has always been possible, but was not previously explicitly stated. This
     does not necessarily apply to a PSA crypto service built on Mbed TLS.

Changes
   * Clarify some current limitations of the PSA driver interface. See the
     documentation of MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_DRIVERS in
     include/mbedtls/mbedtls_config.h.
