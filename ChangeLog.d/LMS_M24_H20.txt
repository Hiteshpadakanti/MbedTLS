    * Add support for the LMS_SHA256_M24_H20 parameter set.
      Height 20 trees allow for 1048576 messages to be signed.
      As such, it is not intended for use in TLS, but instead for
      verification of assets transmitted over an insecure channel,
      particularly firmware images.
      Signature verification is production-ready, but generation is for
      testing purposes only.
