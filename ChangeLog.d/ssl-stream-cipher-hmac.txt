Bugfix
   * Fix a performance regression in (D)TLS with RC4 or a null cipher when
     receiving messages. The code was unnecessarily slow in this case since
     Mbed TLS 2.24 due to a security countermeasure which is only necessary
     for CBC-based cipher suites. Stop using the countermeasure for RC4 and
     null-cipher cipher suites. Fixes #7588.
